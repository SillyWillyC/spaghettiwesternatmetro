        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>
          You and your audiences will eat up this melodrama! With all the classic ingredients — punny names, a meddling villain, and a charming MC who coaches the crowd to boo and cheer — this family-friendly comedy is tailor-made for dinner theatre.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grannie Smith and her clumsy-but-adorable granddaughter, Petunia Pearl, run the Hoot 'n' Holler Hotel. They're behind on the mortgage, and even Sheriff Kirk Ketchum and his self-appointed deputy, Hal Holdem, can't stop dastardly Duke Dreadful from swooping in to buy the place. World traveler Bonnie Voyage returns from Italy with a plan: a spaghetti sauce contest rich enough to pay the mortgage. Grannie and Petunia enter — but Duke, with accomplice Saucy Sally, will stop at nothing to cheat his way to victory and win Petunia's hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Can Sheriff Ketchum save the Hoot 'n' Holler…and win his true love? Let's hope it's not "Mission Im-Pasta-ble!"
        </p>
